# 🎯 Navigator-Strategy Coach Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the **Navigator-Strategy Agent** team! You're now responsible for building the strategic analysis and goal-scoring engine at the heart of SpiceflowNavigator.

## 🚀 Your Mission

**Navigator-Strategy** is the "brain" of the system that:
- 📊 **Analyzes podcast transcripts** for strategic insights
- 🎯 **Scores content relevance** against user goals  
- 💡 **Generates actionable insights** from audio content
- 🔍 **Powers hybrid search** and content matching

## 📂 Repository Structure (Post-Split)

Your team works in the **clean, independent** repository:
```
SpiceflowNavigator-Strategy/
├── analyzer.py              ← Current strategic analyzer (your starting point)
├── common-utils/            ← Shared utilities (git submodule)
│   ├── config.py           ← RSS feed configs
│   └── runpod_client.py    ← Audio transcription client
├── tests/                  ← Your test suite
├── requirements.txt        ← Dependencies
├── Makefile               ← Development commands
└── README.md              ← Repository documentation
```

## 🎯 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Clone Your Repository
```bash
# Clone with CommonUtils submodule
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pa5tabear/SpiceflowNavigator-Strategy.git
cd SpiceflowNavigator-Strategy

# Install dependencies
make install

# Run tests to verify setup
make test
```

### 2. Understand Current Code
```bash
# See what exists
python -c "from analyzer import StrategicAnalyzer; print('Strategy agent ready!')"

# Run the current analyzer
python -c "
from analyzer import StrategicAnalyzer
analyzer = StrategicAnalyzer(['revenue', 'growth'])
result = analyzer.analyze('We need to focus on revenue growth and strategic partnerships.')
print(f'Analysis: {result}')
"
```

### 3. Development Commands
```bash
make help          # Show all commands
make test          # Run tests
make dev           # Start development server
make clean         # Clean temporary files
```

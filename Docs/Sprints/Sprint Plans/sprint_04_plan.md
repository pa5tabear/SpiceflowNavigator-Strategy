# Sprint 4 · Intelligence Correlation & Pattern Detection Engine

## **1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)**

Build Palantir-inspired intelligence correlation engine with entity relationship mapping and cross-source pattern detection capabilities.

## **2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria**

### Task 1: Implement entity relationship mapping engine  
- `pytest -k test_intelligence_entities` green
- Build entity co-occurrence graph across all transcripts
- Calculate relationship strength scores and network density
- Support entity context tracking and temporal analysis

### Task 2: Create cross-source correlation analyzer
- `pytest -k test_intelligence_correlation` green  
- Detect patterns and relationships across different content sources
- Implement topic evolution tracking over time
- Validate claims and detect information flow patterns

### Task 3: Build strategic anomaly detection system
- `pytest -k test_intelligence_anomalies` green
- Detect unusual strategic importance spikes and emerging entities
- Implement sentiment anomaly detection across sources
- Generate actionable intelligence alerts with confidence scoring

## **4 · Workflow**

1. **Think:** Design intelligence architecture - entity mapping → correlation analysis → anomaly detection
2. **Plan:** Create failing tests for all three intelligence components  
3. **Code:** Implement entity relationship mapping with co-occurrence analysis
4. **Test:** Build cross-source correlation engine with temporal tracking
5. **Code:** Create anomaly detection system with strategic alerting
6. **Test:** Validate end-to-end intelligence pipeline with 307KB+ transcript corpus
7. **Review:** Self-check against Palantir-level intelligence quality standards
8. **PR:** Open to `sprint-4` branch with enterprise-grade intelligence capabilities

### **Intelligence Architecture Components**
- **Entity Graph Engine**: Co-occurrence mapping, relationship strength scoring
- **Correlation Analyzer**: Cross-source pattern detection, information flow tracking  
- **Anomaly Detector**: Strategic importance spikes, emerging entity detection
- **Alert Generator**: Confidence-scored intelligence alerts with actionability

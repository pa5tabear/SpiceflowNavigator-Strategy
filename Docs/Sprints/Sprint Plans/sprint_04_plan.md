# Sprint 4 · Analytics Dashboard & Report Generation

## **1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)**

Build analytics dashboard and automated report generation from insights to deliver visual strategic analysis for users.

## **2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria**

### Task 1: Create analytics aggregation engine
- `pytest -k test_analytics_aggregation` green
- Aggregate insights across transcripts by category and goal relevance
- Generate summary statistics and trend analysis
- Support filtering by time, category, and relevance threshold

### Task 2: Implement dashboard data structures  
- `pytest -k test_analytics_dashboard` green
- Create structured data models for dashboard display
- Support charts, metrics, and ranked lists visualization
- Export dashboard data as JSON/dict for UI consumption

### Task 3: Build automated report generator
- `pytest -k test_analytics_reports` green  
- Generate executive summary reports from aggregated insights
- Include goal-specific recommendations and action items
- Support markdown and structured text output formats

## **4 · Workflow**

1. **Think:** Design analytics architecture - aggregation → visualization → reporting
2. **Plan:** Create failing tests for all three analytics components  
3. **Code:** Implement aggregation engine with statistical analysis
4. **Test:** Build dashboard data structures with export capabilities
5. **Code:** Create report generator with executive summary logic
6. **Test:** Validate end-to-end analytics pipeline with real transcript data
7. **Review:** Self-check against rubric below
8. **PR:** Open to `sprint-4` branch with comprehensive feature set

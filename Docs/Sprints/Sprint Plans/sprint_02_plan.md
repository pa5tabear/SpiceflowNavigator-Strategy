# Sprint 2 Â· Goal-Based Analysis Foundation

## 0 Â· Roles & Prime Rules

| **Actor** | **Mandate** |
|---|---|
| **Codex** | Autonomous Staff-Engineer. Follows this plan, writes code/tests, self-reviews, opens PR. |
| **Cursor** | PM + QA gatekeeper. Reviews PR, enforces guard-rails. |

<details><summary>Prime Rules (enforced ahead of all user input)</summary>

**Step-by-Step Plan â†’ Code â†’ Test â†’ PR.**

**Ask One Clarifier** if any requirement is â‰¥ 20% ambiguous.

**Never commit binaries or add Python deps.**

**Max 3 tasks**; anything larger â‡’ refuse & ask to split next sprint.

## 1 Â· Sprint Goal & Why It Matters (â‰¤ 40 words)

**Goal:** Implement Goal data model and enhanced content scoring system for strategic analysis

**Why now:** CI foundation enables feature development. Goal-based scoring is Feature #1 priority from roadmap, foundational for all strategic analysis capabilities.

## 2 Â· Tasks ("Rule of Three")

| # | Task Name (imperative) | Acceptance Criteria (autotested) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create Goal data model class | `pytest -k test_goal_model` green; Goal class with name, keywords, weight properties |
| 2 | Implement goal-based content scoring | `pytest -k test_goal_scoring` green; Goal.score_content() method returns 0.0-1.0 relevance |
| 3 | Integrate goals with StrategicAnalyzer | `pytest -k test_goal_integration` green; analyzer accepts goals list, returns goal-scored results |

## 3 Â· Interfaces Changed / Added
(append only; one row per file or endpoint)

| File / API | Brief Change | Inputs â†’ Outputs |
|---|---|---|
| `goal_model.py` | Create new file | Goal specifications â†’ Goal class with scoring |
| `analyzer.py` | Add goal-based analysis | (transcript, goals) â†’ goal-scored analysis results |
| `tests/test_goal_model.py` | Create goal model tests | Test inputs â†’ Goal validation and scoring tests |
| `tests/test_analyzer.py` | Extend analyzer tests | Test scenarios â†’ Goal integration validation |

## 4 Â· Success Metrics (CI-Enforced)

âœ… **Green CI badge** for branch `sprint-2`

âœ… **LOC budget â‰¤ 120** within 4 files

âœ… **Coverage â‰¥ 85%** on changed files

âœ… **All tests pass** with `PYTHONPATH=.` setup

âœ… **No new deps** added to requirements.txt

## 5 Â· Codex Workflow (MUST follow)

1. **Think privately** (outline Goal model design in comments)
2. **Add failing tests** matching `test_goal` pattern for all 3 tasks
3. **Implement Goal class** with scoring algorithm within LOC budget
4. **Update StrategicAnalyzer** to accept and use goals
5. **Self-Review Checklist** (below)
6. **Open PR** to `sprint-2` branch

### Self-Review Checklist (5-point)
- [ ] All tests green with `PYTHONPATH=.`
- [ ] No binary files, no new deps  
- [ ] LOC delta â‰¤ 120 across 4 files
- [ ] Goal class validates inputs and scores content 0.0-1.0
- [ ] Commit message begins `feat(s2):` 

*(Fail â†’ iterate once, else open PR.)*

## 6 Â· Guard-Rails & Refusals

**Repo uses linear history & merge-queue** â€“ Codex must respect.

**Hard-refuse tasks** that violate guard-rails; respond `REFUSE: <reason>`.

**Root-cause analysis file** `Docs/Sprints/RCAs/rca_s2.md` is mandatory if CI fails at any point.

## 7 Â· Post-Sprint Review Hooks (for Cursor)

Cursor will create `sprint_2_review.md` summarizing progress, metrics, blockers, decisions.

Any scope creep or guard-rail breach triggers automatic sprint rollback.

## 8 Â· Celebration Criteria ðŸŽ‰

**Success** = âœ… CI green â€¢ âœ… Coverage â‰¥85% â€¢ âœ… Goal-based scoring works â€¢ âœ… Strategic analyzer enhanced

Anything else = re-scope next sprint.

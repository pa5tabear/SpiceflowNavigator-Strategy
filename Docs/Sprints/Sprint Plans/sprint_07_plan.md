# Sprint 7 · Strategic Intelligence Reports & Goal-Aligned Insights

## **1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)**

Generate comprehensive markdown reports showing transcript intake analysis and goal-relevant strategic insights for user review.

## **2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria**

### Task 1: Generate comprehensive transcript intake analysis
- `pytest -k test_report_generation` green
- Create `reports/transcript_intake_analysis.md` documenting all 5 transcripts
- Include metadata: file sizes, processing statistics, entity counts, topic coverage
- Generate structured overview showing intelligence corpus scope and quality

### Task 2: Create goal-aligned strategic insights report  
- `pytest -k test_insight_mapping` green
- Create `reports/strategic_insights_report.md` mapping insights to user goals
- Include evidence citations from transcript sources with relevance scoring
- Highlight cross-transcript patterns and correlations relevant to strategic objectives

### Task 3: Build executive intelligence dashboard
- `pytest -k test_executive_dashboard` green
- Create `reports/executive_intelligence_dashboard.md` with executive summary
- Generate actionable recommendations for each strategic goal area
- Include risk/opportunity analysis with supporting intelligence data

## **4 · Workflow**

1. **Think:** Design report architecture - intake analysis → goal mapping → executive dashboard
2. **Plan:** Create failing tests for all three report generation components  
3. **Code:** Build report generator using existing intelligence foundation
4. **Test:** Generate transcript intake analysis with comprehensive metadata
5. **Code:** Create strategic insights mapper linking findings to user goals
6. **Test:** Build executive dashboard with actionable recommendations
7. **Review:** Self-check against enterprise intelligence report standards
8. **PR:** Open to `sprint-7` branch with strategic intelligence reports

### **Report Architecture Components**
- **Report Generator**: Core markdown report creation with data visualization
- **Insight Mapper**: Links transcript intelligence to strategic goals with evidence
- **Executive Analyzer**: Generates executive summaries and recommendations  
- **Report Templates**: Professional formatting for business intelligence presentation

## **5 · Self-Review Rubric**

# Sprint 6 · Intelligence Correlation Foundation

## **1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)**

Build cross-source correlation engine and advanced entity relationship mapping with confidence scoring on entity foundation.

## **2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria**

### Task 1: Implement cross-source correlation analyzer
- `pytest -k test_correlation_analysis` green
- Detect patterns and validate claims across different transcript sources
- Calculate correlation confidence scores between sources
- Identify information flow patterns and cross-validation opportunities

### Task 2: Create advanced entity relationship mapping
- `pytest -k test_correlation_entities` green  
- Build comprehensive entity network with relationship strength scoring
- Implement relationship confidence assessment and validation
- Generate network density metrics and clustering analysis

### Task 3: Create comprehensive intelligence demonstration
- `pytest -k test_correlation_demo` green
- Build demo script showcasing end-to-end intelligence pipeline from transcripts to insights
- Generate comprehensive intelligence report with visualizable data exports
- Create executive summary demonstrating all capabilities: goal scoring, insights, aggregation, entities, correlations

## **4 · Workflow**

1. **Think:** Design correlation architecture - cross-source validation → entity networks → anomaly detection
2. **Plan:** Create failing tests for all three correlation components  
3. **Code:** Build cross-source correlation analyzer using existing entity data
4. **Test:** Implement advanced entity relationship mapping with confidence scoring
5. **Code:** Create strategic anomaly detection with alert generation
6. **Test:** Validate correlation pipeline processes full entity foundation with intelligence quality
7. **Review:** Self-check against intelligence correlation standards
8. **PR:** Open to `sprint-6` branch with intelligence correlation capabilities

### **Intelligence Architecture Components**
- **Correlation Analyzer**: Cross-source pattern detection and validation
- **Entity Network Mapper**: Advanced relationship mapping with confidence scoring  
- **Anomaly Detector**: Strategic importance spikes and emerging pattern detection
- **Intelligence Synthesizer**: Confidence-scored insights with actionability assessment

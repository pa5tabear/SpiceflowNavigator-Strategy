# Sprint 5 · Enhanced Pattern Detection & Simple Entity Tracking

## **1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)**

Build basic entity tracking across transcripts and simple relationship detection between common entities.

## **2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria**

### Task 1: Implement basic entity tracking engine
- `pytest -k test_entity_tracking` green
- Track entities (people, companies, technologies) across all 5 transcripts
- Calculate entity frequency and prominence scores across corpus
- Maintain source attribution for each entity mention

### Task 2: Create simple entity relationship detection
- `pytest -k test_entity_relationships` green  
- Identify entities that appear together in same transcripts
- Calculate basic co-occurrence strength between entity pairs
- Generate simple entity network data for visualization

### Task 3: Build timeline visualization data structure
- `pytest -k test_entity_timeline` green
- Track when entities are mentioned across transcript timeline
- Create temporal data structure for topic and entity evolution
- Export timeline data as JSON for future dashboard integration

## **4 · Workflow**

1. **Think:** Design entity tracking - identify entities → track relationships → create timeline
2. **Plan:** Create failing tests for all three entity components  
3. **Code:** Build entity tracking engine using existing transcript insights
4. **Test:** Implement simple relationship detection with co-occurrence analysis
5. **Code:** Create timeline visualization data structure with temporal tracking
6. **Test:** Validate entity pipeline processes full 307KB corpus with aggregation integration
7. **Review:** Self-check against incremental complexity standards
8. **PR:** Open to `sprint-5` branch with enhanced pattern detection capabilities

### **Entity Architecture Components**
- **Entity Tracker**: Identifies and tracks entities across all transcripts
- **Relationship Detector**: Finds co-occurrence patterns between entities  
- **Timeline Builder**: Creates temporal data structure for entity evolution
- **Visualization Exporter**: Generates structured data for future dashboard features

## **5 · Self-Review Rubric**

- [ ] All `test_entity*` tests green with real 307KB+ data corpus
- [ ] Entity tracking identifies people, companies, technologies across transcripts
- [ ] Relationship detection calculates meaningful co-occurrence patterns  
- [ ] Timeline data structure tracks entity mentions with temporal context
- [ ] Entity data integrates cleanly with existing aggregation foundation
- [ ] Visualization export provides structured JSON for future dashboard consumption
- [ ] Clean integration with existing goal scoring, insights, and aggregation systems
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for missing entities or malformed data
- [ ] No new dependencies added to requirements.txt
- [ ] Commit message begins `feat(s5): enhanced pattern detection`

## **6 · Proposed Next Sprint**

Sprint 6: Intelligence Correlation Foundation - Advanced entity relationship mapping with confidence scoring.

## **Demo-able Capability**

**Users can now experience complete strategic intelligence pipeline:**

1. **End-to-End Intelligence Analysis** - Run complete pipeline from 307KB energy transcripts through goal scoring, insight extraction, aggregation, entity tracking, and correlation analysis to final intelligence summary

2. **Cross-Source Correlation** - Use `CorrelationAnalyzer` to detect patterns across different transcript sources, validate claims, and identify information flow patterns with confidence scoring

3. **Executive Intelligence Summary** - Generate comprehensive intelligence report demonstrating all capabilities: strategic relevance scoring, business insights categorization, entity relationship networks, and cross-source validation

**Demo Script Available:**
```python
from analytics import run_complete_intelligence_demo
demo_results = run_complete_intelligence_demo()
# Returns: Executive summary with visualizable exports showing full capabilities
```

**Tangible Business Value:** Complete strategic intelligence platform ready for stakeholder demonstration with professional-grade analysis outputs

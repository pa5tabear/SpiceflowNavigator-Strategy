# Sprint 01 - Cursor PM+QA Review

## Progress & Status
- **Sprint Goal**: Fix CI pipeline by resolving submodule dependency and establish green build foundation
- **Plan Status**: ‚úÖ **Complete** - Template v2.0 compliant sprint plan created
- **Execution Status**: ‚ùå **NOT STARTED** - Codex has not executed Sprint 01 tasks
- **Deliverables Shipped**: 0/3 tasks completed
- **Overall Status**: **BLOCKED** - CI pipeline remains in failure state

## Green Badges & Metrics
- **Passing CI Jobs**: 0/6 (no improvement from Sprint 00)
- **Test Coverage**: Unknown (tests cannot run due to CI failure)
- **LOC Delta**: 0 (no code changes executed)
- **Sprint Plan Quality**: ‚úÖ Template v2.0 compliant with all required sections

## Demo-able Capability
**Current User Experience (UNCHANGED):**
- ‚úÖ Basic strategic analysis via `analyzer.py` (locally functional)
- ‚ùå **CI/CD Pipeline**: Still completely non-functional
- ‚ùå **Automated Testing**: Still cannot execute due to submodule failure
- ‚ùå **PR Workflow**: Still blocked by failing CI

**No new capabilities delivered this sprint.**

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**Critical Blockers (UNCHANGED):**
- üö® **Sprint Execution**: Codex has not started Sprint 01 work
- üö® **Submodule Dependency**: Still pointing to non-existent repository
- üö® **CI Pipeline**: Still 100% failure rate
- üö® **Development Velocity**: 0% (cannot merge any PRs)

**Escalating Risks:**
- Planning without execution creates documentation debt
- CI failure continues to block all development workflows

## Failing CI Steps
**UNCHANGED from Sprint 00:**
- **Job**: `test` ‚Üí **Step**: `Checkout code` ‚Üí **Error**: 
  ```
  fatal: repository 'pa5tabear/SpiceflowNavigator-CommonUtils.git/' not found
  fatal: clone of submodule path failed
  ```

## TODOs Merged
**None** - No code execution occurred during Sprint 01 cycle

## Decisions Needed
- **Sprint Execution**: Should Codex execute Sprint 01 plan immediately?
- **Workflow Process**: How to trigger autonomous Staff Engineer execution?
- **CI Priority**: Continue blocking all work until CI is green?
- **Planning Cadence**: Should we continue planning while execution is pending?

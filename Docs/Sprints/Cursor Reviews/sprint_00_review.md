# Sprint 00 - Pre-Sprint Review

## Progress & Status
- **Repository State**: Fresh setup with navigator-strategy-coach documentation added
- **Current Functionality**: Basic `StrategicAnalyzer` class with keyword-based analysis
- **Sprint Goal**: Pre-development assessment - no prior sprint goals
- **Status**: **BLOCKED** - CI pipeline completely broken due to submodule issues

## Green Badges & Metrics  
- **Passing CI Jobs**: 0/6 (all failing)
- **Test Coverage**: Unknown (cannot run tests due to CI failure)
- **LOC Delta**: +5,000 lines (documentation and starter code added)
- **Python Versions**: Targeting 3.9, 3.10, 3.11

## Demo-able Capability
**Current User Experience:**
- ‚úÖ Basic strategic analysis via `analyzer.py` (locally functional)
- ‚úÖ Goal-based keyword matching (simple implementation)
- ‚ùå **CI/CD Pipeline**: Completely non-functional
- ‚ùå **Automated Testing**: Cannot execute due to submodule failure

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**Critical Blockers:**
- üö® **Submodule Dependency**: `common-utils` points to non-existent repository
- üö® **CI Pipeline**: 100% failure rate blocking all development workflows
- üö® **Test Execution**: Cannot validate code changes or run quality checks

**Cost Impact:**
- Development velocity: 0% (cannot merge PRs with failing CI)
- Code quality risk: High (no automated validation)

## Failing CI Steps
**All Python Versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11):**
- **Job**: `test` ‚Üí **Step**: `Checkout code` ‚Üí **Error**: 
  ```
  fatal: repository 'https://github.com/pa5tabear/SpiceflowNavigator-CommonUtils.git/' not found
  fatal: clone of 'git@github.com:pa5tabear/SpiceflowNavigator-CommonUtils.git' into submodule path failed
  ```

## TODOs Merged
**None** - No development work completed due to CI blockage

## Decisions Needed
- **CommonUtils Strategy**: Remove submodule dependency or create missing repository?
- **CI Configuration**: Adjust workflow to handle missing submodule gracefully?
- **Development Approach**: Proceed with local-only development or fix CI first?
- **Priority**: Is CI fix Sprint 01 priority or should we work around it?

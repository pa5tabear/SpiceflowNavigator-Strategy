# Sprint 02 - Cursor PM+QA Review

## Progress & Status
- **Sprint Goal**: Implement Goal data model with user strategic objectives and energy podcast test data
- **Plan Status**: ‚úÖ **Complete** - Comprehensive plan with user goals integration
- **Execution Status**: ‚ùå **NOT STARTED** - Codex has not executed Sprint 2 tasks
- **Deliverables Shipped**: 0/3 tasks completed
- **Overall Status**: **BLOCKED** - CI regressed to failure, no development progress

## Green Badges & Metrics
- **Passing CI Jobs**: 0/6 (regression from Sprint 1 success)
- **Test Coverage**: Unchanged - no new code executed
- **LOC Delta**: 0 (no implementation work done)
- **Files Created**: 0 of 6 planned files (goal_model.py, download script, transcripts)
- **Sprint Plan Quality**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive with user goals integration

## Demo-able Capability
**Current User Experience (UNCHANGED from Sprint 1):**
- ‚úÖ Basic strategic analysis via `analyzer.py` (locally functional)
- ‚úÖ Test foundation established (2 passing tests)
- ‚ùå **CI/CD Pipeline**: Regressed to failure state
- ‚ùå **Goal-Based Analysis**: Not implemented
- ‚ùå **Energy Transcript Collection**: Not executed
- ‚ùå **Strategic Scoring**: Not available

**No new capabilities delivered this sprint.**

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**Critical Blockers:**
- üö® **Sprint Execution Gap**: Codex autonomous execution not triggered
- üö® **CI Regression**: Pipeline reverted from success to failure
- üö® **Development Velocity**: 0% - no code changes made
- üö® **Feature Development**: Goal-based analysis blocked

**Escalating Risks:**
- Planning-execution disconnect creating documentation debt
- CI instability preventing confident development
- User goals framework remains unimplemented despite clear requirements

## Failing CI Steps
**CI Regression** - Status changed from `success` (Sprint 1) to `failure`
Need to investigate specific failure points to understand root cause of regression.

## TODOs Merged
**None** - No code execution occurred during Sprint 2 cycle

## Decisions Needed
- **Execution Trigger**: How to activate Codex for Sprint 2 autonomous execution?
- **CI Investigation**: Root cause analysis for regression from working to failing state
- **Development Process**: Address gap between planning and execution phases  
- **Sprint Cadence**: Should we continue planning while execution remains pending?
- **Priority**: Fix CI regression first or proceed with Sprint 2 goals?
